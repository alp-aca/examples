# ALPaca: Examples

ALPaca is the ALP Automatic Computing Algorithm, the open-source python library designed to study the phenomenology of ALPs with $m_a \sim \mathcal{O}(\mathrm{GeV})$ in mesonic processes.

## Citing

If you use ALPaca in your publications, do not forget to use the following reference:

```bibtex
@article{ALPaca:2025Manual,
    author = "Alda, J. and Fuentes Zamoro, M., and Merlo, L., and Ponce Diaz, X., and Rigolin, S.",
    title = "ALPaca: the ALP Automatic Computing Algorithm",
    journal = "In preparation."
}
```

Additionally, if you find interesting the phenomenology studied in any of the publications linked above, use also the corresponding references.
